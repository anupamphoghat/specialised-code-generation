Fine-Tuning Gemma for Specialized Code Generation
This repository provides a complete, step-by-step guide and associated scripts to fine-tune Google's Gemma model on a specific programming language or framework. The goal is to create a specialized code assistant tailored to your needs.

We will use a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method called Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This technique is highly effective as it allows us to adapt the model to a new task without retraining all of its billions of parameters, saving significant time and computational resources.

Repository Structure
1_data_preparation.ipynb: A notebook for sourcing, cleaning, and formatting your custom dataset for fine-tuning.

2_finetune_gemma.ipynb: The core notebook that loads the base Gemma model, applies LoRA adapters, and runs the fine-tuning process on your prepared dataset.

3_inference.ipynb: A notebook to load your newly fine-tuned model and test its specialized code generation capabilities.

requirements.txt: A list of all necessary Python libraries.

The Fine-Tuning Workflow
The process is broken down into three main stages:

1. Data Preparation (The Most Crucial Step)
The quality of your fine-tuned model is entirely dependent on the quality of your dataset. The goal is to create a dataset of high-quality examples that follow a consistent format. For a code assistant, a "prompt-response" format is ideal.

Example format for a Python Pandas assistant:

{
  "prompt": "How do I select all rows in a Pandas DataFrame where the 'age' column is greater than 30?",
  "response": "You can use boolean indexing to filter the DataFrame. Here's the code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = {'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'], 'age': [25, 42, 31, 19]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Select rows where age > 30\nolder_than_30 = df[df['age'] > 30]\nprint(older_than_30)\n```"
}

This notebook (1_data_preparation.ipynb) will guide you through creating or sourcing data and structuring it into a dataset.jsonl file, ready for training.

2. Fine-Tuning with LoRA
This stage involves teaching the base Gemma model about our specific domain (e.g., the Pandas library). The 2_finetune_gemma.ipynb notebook handles this by:

Loading the base Gemma model (e.g., gemma-2b-it) in 4-bit precision to reduce memory usage.

Adding LoRA adapters to the model. These are small, trainable layers that are injected into the model's architecture.

Loading the custom dataset.

Running the training loop, where only the LoRA adapters are updated. The original weights of the Gemma model remain frozen.

Saving the trained LoRA adapters. The output isn't a whole new model, but rather a small file containing the "learned knowledge."

3. Inference and Testing
Once the model is fine-tuned, the 3_inference.ipynb notebook demonstrates how to:

Load the original base Gemma model.

Load and "merge" your trained LoRA adapters into the model.

Use the now-specialized model to respond to prompts related to your domain. You should see a marked improvement in the quality and relevance of its responses compared to the base model.

Getting Started
To begin, create a project folder, set up a Python virtual environment, and install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt. Then, proceed with the notebooks in order, starting with data preparation.

This structured approach ensures that you have a clear path from data collection to a functional, specialized AI code assistant. Now, let's look at the code.
